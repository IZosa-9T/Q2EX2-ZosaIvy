			<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>Heyayaya! I’m Ivy, I was born and raised in the Philippines (10/04/10), but I'm not very good at tagalog. I am a Grade 9 student at OB Montessori, constantly exploring new subjects and expanding my knowledge. I have a deep interest in <strong>social studies and values education</strong>, particularly in how society shapes the world around us and philosophy.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				I’m also passionate about <strong>art</strong>. I aspire to become an artist one day, and I’m working hard to gain more experience and improve my skills in various forms of artistic expression. Creating art is not just a hobby for me but also a way to express myself. In my free time, I’m either scrolling through online art galleries or sketching new ideas. I look for inspiration and creative ways to explore my interests.</p>


			<h3>Interests</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><button data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#read">Reading</button></li>	
						<div id="read" class="collapse" style="color: gray;">
							<p>Reading is one of the ways i use to calm myself down. Reading distracts me from stress, noise, and my problems. But whether im stressed or not, I enjoy reading in my freetime.</p>
							</div>
					<li><button data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#art">Art</button></li>
						<div id="art" class="collapse" style="color: gray;">
							<p>As I mentioned earlier, I'm really passionate about art, which I use both as a way to express my feelings and to relax. It’s my favorite way to unwind and get creative.</p>
						</div>
					<li><button data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#games">Video games</button></li>
						<div id="games" class="collapse" style="color: gray;">
							<p>I love playing video games, not in a way that I wouldnt shower just to stare at my screen tho. Playing games, for me, is a great source of entertainment and its even better with friends!</p>
						</div>
					<li><button data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#sleep">Sleeping</button></li>
						<div id="sleep" class="collapse" style="color: gray;">
							<p>I am aware that sleeping is more of a habit rather than a hobby. But nowadays, for me, it really is hard to get enough sleep so I can work well. I truly enjoy sleeping or taking a nap even if its only 30 minutes to a few hours.</p>
